In particular, that means making it so that product teams (machines, managed postgres, proxy/networking, etc.) can operate the products they’re building well.

Some things you might work on:

Setting up and iterating on tooling for metrics/monitoring and alerting, so that product teams can reliably operate their products.
Writing lots of “glue” code integrating various tools in ways that are valuable (and easy to use) for product teams.
Piecing tools together in clever/new/interesting ways to solve product team needs.
Helping refine capacity planning, and automating quick burst capacity (for when our capacity planning isn’t quite right).
Building the underlying hosting infrastructure that allows product teams to run multi-tenant workloads without having to worry about individual hosts.
Responding to hardware failures, and interfacing with our provider to get hardware changed out as needed.
Making it easy and safe (and as automatic as possible) to make changes to critical system components (like upgrading the OS on our servers).
Working with our upstream providers to debug hairy networking issues.

This role will be a good fit for you if:

You’re good at figuring out what product teams really need in order to build and operate their products.
You know core infrastructure tech concepts and tools (linux, networking, etc.).
You’re good at debugging, figuring out weird stuff, picking up new tools and ways of doing things, and you can do it all under pressure.
You can work autonomously — you can look at a big problem, and figure out a small piece to work on next, without being told what to do, and you can see the long-term vision of where to go after that.
You are very effective at written communication. You can write concisely, focusing on the most important points, and you consider your audience.
You are good at sharing ownership and working on a team.
You move fast. This absolutely does not mean you over-work yourself (we want you to work normal human hours and take care of yourself), but it means that you’re decisive, work with purpose, and don’t let yourself get bogged down in less impactful work.

You’ll know you’re succeeding in your job if:

You’re always thinking about how folks on the product teams are using the tools you’re building, and what problem you’re solving for them.
Your solutions are broadly useful. You probably had one small initial use-case in mind, but the thing you built gets used again and again, by several different product teams.
Product teams at Fly.io are able to build new features fast on top of the infrastructure you’ve built.
Product teams at Fly.io are able to operate their products effectively. They know when their product is working (and when it’s not), and have the tools they need to quickly solve problems.","March 13, 2025"
UX Engineer - Senior,fly.io,https://fly.io/jobs/ux-engineer/,"Chicago, United States",Chicago,United States,"A UX engineer at Fly.io is a primarily an Elixir developer. The work is primarily front-end and interaction design.

But Fly.io isn’t primarily written in Elixir, and every decision we make from button sizes to distributed consensus algorithms is driven by user needs. 


What We’re Doing Now

We’ve got two big product pushes happening in 2025.

The first is MPG, our upcoming Managed Postgres offering. Managed databases let users create databases and then not worry about them. Databases are complicated: lots of knobs, lots of flashing lights. We need the knobs simplified and the lights curated, so that MPG is telling the story users need to here, and not confusing them with other stuff.

The second use case is LLM execution environments. A crazy thing happens when you give a hallucination-prone LLM access to a secure, ephemeral environment with which to actually compile and run code: the LLM actually gets good at coding. We’ve got a handle on the core engine of generating code and getting it to run safely. But what is the UX of that as a product? What does it mean to start a new LLM-driven project, and what does it mean for it to be finished, put into production, maintained, and extended? We’re looking for somebody with takes.

Seriously, This Is A Fussy Role

We’re not afraid to talk you out of it. You’d need to be:

Attuned to the needs of the kinds of users that ship things on public clouds. Check out our public community if you think that’s easy to do consistently.

Platform Engineer: Proxy - Senior,fly.io,https://fly.io/jobs/platform-proxy/,"Chicago, United States",Chicago,United States,"We’re looking for engineers to join the team working on our Anycast network and its core component, fly-proxy.

What We’re Doing Now

There are two big projects happening with our network stack right now.

The first is regionalization. We’ve gotten as far as we’re going to get with a single flat global topology. The next iteration of our proxy architecture runs multiple Corrosion instances, for each region, and publishes summary information to the global cloud; for a deep-cut analogy, think of how OSPF does areas. This has profound implications on how our proxies handle things like balancing and fly-replay.

The second big project is evolving our private networking primitives. This will involve giving Fly Machines stable addresses that can be moved from hardware server to hardware server, and providing finer-grained access control, so that it’s even easier to run untrusted workloads on Fly Machines without having to do fiddly things inside of Fly Machines.

We think these are fun problems. We can’t promise they won’t be stressful problems. If that’s a kind of bittersweet you’re interested in, let’s see if we’d work well together.

The salary for this role is $190 to $225k USD, depending on level.

Platform Engineer: Fly Machines - Senior,fly.io,https://fly.io/jobs/platform-machines/,"Chicago, United States",Chicago,United States,"We’re looking for engineers to join the team working on Fly Machines and their orchestrator, flyd.

What We’re Doing Now :

Fly Machines are making a beeline towards enabling two big internal use cases for us.

The first is MPG, our upcoming Managed Postgres offering. Being a platform for managed database means being good both at managing compute resources and, especially, storage — and we’re chasing down a bunch of interesting ideas there. But more than anything else it involves making machines move, and improving and tooling up machine migration so we can transparently shuffle workloads.

The second use case is LLM execution environments. A crazy thing happens when you give a hallucination-prone LLM access to a secure, ephemeral environment with which to actually compile and run code: the LLM actually gets good at coding. Making this work well for customers means giving Fly Machines safe access to APIs and secrets without exposing them to untrusted code, and managing gigantic pools of machines.

We think these are fun problems. We can’t promise they won’t be stressful problems. If that’s a kind of bittersweet you’re interested in, let’s see if we’d work well together.
